- [x] Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Detection Using CNN |Major Project


- [x] Developed an Alzheimer's disease detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), leveraging deep learning techniques to analyze brain imaging data and 
      accurately classify Alzheimer's disease cases with high precision and recall rates.

- [x] Preprocessed and augmented large-scale brain MRI datasets, employing advanced techniques such as image normalization, cropping, and data augmentation to enhance model          performance and handle variations in brain images.

- [x] Conducted rigorous model evaluation and validation, utilizing appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, demonstrating the 
      robustness and reliability of the CNN-based Alzheimer's disease detection system.

- [x] Applied CNN to produce a final model with an accuracy of 92.92%.

- [x] To run the application do run the file app.py.
